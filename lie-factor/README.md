# Lie Factor

Lie factor = (size of effect shown in graph) / (size of effect in data) = A / B

1. Assume the total height of the graph is H = 1000 px
2. A:
   - Before: ((150-79.8)/150) * H = 0.468 * H
   - After:  1 * H

   B:
   - Before: 145.2-79.8 = 65.4
   - After:  145.2-79.8 = 65.4

3. Lie factor:
   - Before: 0.468 * H / 65.4 = 0.0071559633 * H = 7.16
   - After:  H / 65.4 = 0.01529051987 * H = 15.29
